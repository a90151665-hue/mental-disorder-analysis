 Mental-Disorder-Analysis
 
 This project focuses on analyzing a Mental Disorders dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Google Colab, followed by building an interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize insights.
 
The goal is to understand behavioral, demographic, and lifestyle factors that may influence different mental health conditions.

This Project Includes

1,Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Google Colab

Understanding dataset structure

Data cleaning & preprocessing

Handling missing values

Statistical summary

Univariate & bivariate analysis

Correlation analysis

Visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn

A dynamic dashboard created using Power BI to visualize:

Disorder distribution

Severity levels

Gender & age analysis

Lifestyle factors

Trends & patterns

KPIs and slicers for easy exploration

The EDA performed in Google Colab includes:

Data loading and inspection

Finding patterns across demographic variables

Detecting correlations between mental disorders and lifestyle factors

Visualizations such as heatmaps, histograms, countplots, boxplots, pairplots, etc.

Key Insights 

Anxiety and depression appeared as the most common disorders

Most cases were observed in people aged 20–35

Lack of sleep and high stress levels strongly related to severe symptoms

Some disorders showed differences across gender groups

Lifestyle patterns played a major role in overall mental health

This project uses both statistical analysis and interactive visual analytics to understand mental health patterns.
The combination of Python EDA and Power BI Dashboard provides a strong, practical approach for deriving insights from real-world mental health data.
